                    London (/ˈlʌndən/ (About this soundlisten) LUN-dən) 
                    is the capital and largest city of both England 
                    and the United Kingdom.[9][10] 
                    Standing on the River Thames in 
                    the south-east of England, 
                    at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary 
                    leading to the North Sea, 
                    London has been a major settlement for two millennia.
                    Londinium was founded by the Romans.[11] 
                    The City of London, London's ancient core − 
                    an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) 
                    and colloquially known as the Square Mile − 
                    retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.
                    [12][13][14][15][16][note 1] The City of Westminster is 
                    also an Inner London borough holding city status. 
                    Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London 
                    and the London Assembly.
